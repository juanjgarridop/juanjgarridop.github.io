      <title>Aural Comprehension of Cognates:The role of phonological factors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though the claim that cognates are comprehended more accurately than non-cognates in the visual modality is uncontroversial, it is still uncertain what role phonology plays in the comprehension of cognates. Research on cognates focuses mainly on the visual modality (e.g., Sherkina-Lieber, 2004; Hoshino and Kroll, 2008; Tonzar et al, 2009; Tercedor, 2010; among others) whereas the aural modality remains to be explored in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the role of phonological factors in the aural comprehension of cognates in learners of Spanish as a second language.  For this study, Spanish-English cognates were classified in four groups of 12 cognates on the basis of their shared phonological features (i.e., stressed syllable) and the degree of phonological overlap (i.e., number of shared phonemes). Group 1 included cognates that share 1 or 2 phonemes and the stressed syllable, e.g., “control” [kənˈtroʊɫ] and “control” [konˈtɾol]. Group 2 had cognates that share 1 or 2 phonemes but not the stressed syllable. For example, “activity” [ækˈthɪvətɪ] and “actividad” [aktiβiˈðað]. Group 3 included cognates that share 3 or more phonemes and the stressed syllable. For example, “center” [ˈsɛntɚ] and “centro” [ˈsentɾo]. Finally, Group 4 was comprised of cognates that share 3 or more phonemes but not the stressed syllable. For instance, “information” [ˌɪnfɚˈmeɪʃən] and “información” [imfoɾmaˈsjon].
Sixty-two learners of Spanish as a second language performed translation tasks. Participants were divided into two groups: Control Group (32 participants), who encountered isolated words visually; and Experimental Group (30 participants), who encountered isolated words aurally. Both groups were asked to translate 48 cognates (12 from each category) and 15 non-cognates in the corresponding modalities. All the words used in the stimuli were frequent in both languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary non-parametric analyses suggest that the degree of phonological overlap may affect the comprehension of cognates. In terms of the aural modality, preliminary analyses suggest that the number of shared phonemes might not have a great effect on the comprehension of cognates with 95% CIs [15.8, 19.8] and [15.8, 20] for cognates that share 1 or 2 phonemes and 3 or 4 phonemes respectively; however, participants seemed to perform slightly better with cognates that do not share a stressed syllable with 95% CIs [16.5, 20.6] and [15, 19] for cognates that share and do not share the stressed syllable in order. In terms of the visual modality, preliminary analyses indicate that the number of shared phonemes and the stressed syllable might have an effect on the comprehension of cognates since participants performed better with cognates that share 1 or 2 phonemes - 95% CIs [21.5, 22.6] than with cognates that share 3 or 4 phonemes - 95% CIs [20, 21.7]. They also performed better with cognates that do not share a stressed syllable than with cognates that share a stressed syllable with 95% CIs [21.64, 22.7] and [20, 21.63] respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that phonological factors might have an effect on the comprehension of cognates in both the visual and the aural modalities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predictive Processing of Gender Agreement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that native speakers of Spanish use gender-marked articles to predict upcoming nouns during online processing (Lew-Williams &amp;amp; Fernald, 2007, 2010). However, other studies on adult second language (L2) learners found that L2 learners do not use grammatical gender to predict upcoming information, or at least, not in the same way as native speakers do. This difference seems to depend on different factors such as target gender assignment (Hopp, 2012), the strength of lexical representations (Hopp, 2016), the number of cues available (Fowler &amp;amp; Jackson, 2017), among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the present study, I explore whether adult L2 learners and native speakers of Spanish use grammatical gender predictively during online processing. Particularly, I examine whether and under what conditions native and non-native speakers of Spanish use gender-marked articles and nouns to identify upcoming nouns and adjectives. This study explores the following research questions: 1) Do English-speaking adult L2 learners of Spanish process gender agreement in Spanish predictively? If so, do target-like gender assignment and agreement in production and comprehension correlate with the use of grammatical gender for predictive processing? 2) Does the number of gender cues available affect the use of grammatical gender for predictive processing? 3) Does the level of proficiency have an effect on the predictive use of gender?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirty adult English-speaking learners and thirty native speakers of Spanish will perform a picture-naming task and a picture-identification task to test gender assignment and agreement in production and comprehension, and an eye-tracking task to test predictive processing of grammatical gender. I predict that (1) only the participants who show mastery of gender assignment and agreement will be able to use gender predictively, (2) participants will be more likely to use gender cues predictively when they have a higher number of cues available, and (3) the higher the proficiency level, the more participants will exploit gender cues for predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study contributes to our understanding of how L2 learners process gender information during online comprehension and what factors might intervene in using grammatical gender during L2 predictive processing.&lt;/p&gt;
