A total of 225 adult L2 Spanish learners (L1 English) from the Northeastern United States completed a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task in which they listened to four utterance types and categorized them as either questions or statements. We used Bayesian multilevel regression and drift diffusion modeling to analyze the 2AFC data as a function of proficiency level and empathy scores for each utterance type. We show that learner response accuracy and sensitivity to intonation are positively correlated with proficiency, and this association is affected by individual empathy levels in both response accuracy and sentence processing. Higher empathic individuals, in comparison with lower empathic individuals, appear to be more sensitive to intonation cues in the process of forming sound-meaning associations, though increased sensitivity does not necessarily imply increased processing speed. The results motivate the inclusion of measures of pragmatic skill, such as empathy, to better account for intonational meaning processing and sentence comprehension in second language acquisition.","tags":[],"title":"Using intonation to disambiguate meaning: The role of empathy and proficiency in L2 perceptual development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Garrido-Pozú, Juan J.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691798400,"objectID":"407805893b442d1721e88fd5d2d45b31","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/publication/word-spotting/","publishdate":"2023-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/word-spotting/","section":"publication","summary":"Current understanding of speech perception suggests that the routines that listeners use to segment the speech signal for word recognition are language specific. English speakers exploit stress patterns for lexical segmentation whereas Spanish speakers use syllable structure. This study investigated L2 lexical segmentation and specifically examined whether L2 learners with a syllable-based L1 (Spanish) exhibit stress-based segmentation in L2 English. 81 English-Spanish learners and 72 Spanish-English learners completed a word-spotting task that manipulated lexical stress and syllable structure. Participants aurally identified English monosyllabic words embedded in disyllabic pseudowords. Results showed that Spanish-English learners transferred L1 segmentation routines to L2 English. Spanish-English learners exhibited syllable-based segmentation of English regardless of differences in lexical stress, which was more prominent as L2 proficiency increased. English-Spanish learners showed stress-based segmentation regardless of differences in syllable structure. This study suggests that listeners develop only the segmentation routines that correspond to the phonological composition of their L1.","tags":[],"title":"L2 speech segmentation for word recognition: The role of lexical stress and syllable structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Garrido-Pozú, Juan J.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662595200,"objectID":"6c3d0248a4840d647a9ef3dfcb46a4f7","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/publication/predictive-processing/","publishdate":"2022-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/predictive-processing/","section":"publication","summary":"The present study investigated whether Spanish monolinguals and English learners of Spanish use grammatical gender information in articles and nouns to facilitate the processing of upcoming adjectives. Specifically, this study examined the role of noun transparency, the number of gender cues, and L2 proficiency. The results of an eye-tracking task revealed that Spanish monolinguals predicted the gender of upcoming adjectives much sooner than L2 learners. L2 learners used grammatical gender predictively, but their predictions were delayed compared to monolinguals. Advanced L2 learners predicted upcoming adjectives faster than intermediate learners. Notably, transparent nouns and a higher number of gender cues increased target fixations in all groups. Target fixations of advanced learners increased especially with transparent nouns, and target fixations of intermediate learners were higher with more gender cues present. The results showed that L2 learners can integrate L2 morphosyntactic information during rapid speech processing, and that transparently marked nouns and more gender cues aid gender processing.","tags":[],"title":"Predictive processing of grammatical gender: Using gender cues to facilitate processing in Spanish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lozano-Argüelles, C.","Fernández Arroyo, L.","Rodríguez, N.","Durand López, E.M.","**Garrido Pozú, J.J.**","Markovits Rojas, J.","Varela, J.","Rocafiguera, N.","and Casillas, J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626739200,"objectID":"32e57f901d46c2a9cfcd4afd3d502e3e","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/publication/double-phonemic-boundary/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/double-phonemic-boundary/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous studies attest that early bilinguals can modify their perceptual identification according to the fine-grained phonetic detail of the language they believe they are hearing. Following Gonzales et al. (2019), we replicate the double phonemic boundary effect in late learners (LBs) using conceptual-based cueing. We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, “voiceless” responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in LBs and supports accounts positing selective activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.","tags":[],"title":"Conceptually-cued perceptual categorization in adult L2 learners","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Garrido"],"categories":null,"content":"  \n \n","date":1555027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555027200,"objectID":"96344c08df50a1b693cc40432115cbe3","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/talk/example/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/example/","section":"talk","summary":"Predictive Processing of Grammatical Gender by Native and Non-native Speakers of Spanish","tags":[],"title":"Predictive Processing of Grammatical Gender by Native and Non-native Speakers of Spanish","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Juan Garrido","Gilda Socarras"],"categories":null,"content":"  \n \n","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"b5eba9e514744cce21d0cdf0042552c5","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/talk/cognates/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cognates/","section":"talk","summary":"Aural Comprehension of Cognates:The role of phonological factors","tags":[],"title":"Aural Comprehension of Cognates:The role of phonological factors","type":"talk"}]
