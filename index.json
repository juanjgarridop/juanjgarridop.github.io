Following Gonzales et al. (2019), we replicate the double phonemic boundary effect in late learners (LBs) using conceptual-based cueing. We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, “voiceless” responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in LBs and supports accounts positing selective activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.","tags":[],"title":"Conceptually-cued perceptual categorization in adult L2 learners","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Garrido"],"categories":null,"content":"  \n \n","date":1555027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555027200,"objectID":"96344c08df50a1b693cc40432115cbe3","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/talk/example/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/example/","section":"talk","summary":"Predictive Processing of Grammatical Gender by Native and Non-native Speakers of Spanish","tags":[],"title":"Predictive Processing of Grammatical Gender by Native and Non-native Speakers of Spanish","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Juan Garrido","Gilda Socarras"],"categories":null,"content":"  \n \n","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"b5eba9e514744cce21d0cdf0042552c5","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/talk/cognates/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cognates/","section":"talk","summary":"Aural Comprehension of Cognates:The role of phonological factors","tags":[],"title":"Aural Comprehension of Cognates:The role of phonological factors","type":"talk"}]
