English L2 learners of Spanish were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Both groups completed a pre/post lexical decision task containing L2 words with either two or three morphemes, and a pre/post lexical frequency task. In addition, the treatment group completed four sessions in which they read texts containing low frequency words. Linear mixed models and Bayes factors were used to analyze participants’ performance.Both groups took significantly longer to process morphologically complex words with three than with two morphemes at pretest. While this pattern was observed also at posttest for the control group, the treatment group took roughly the same to process both types of words following training. Taken together, the findings suggest that an increased exposure to low-frequency L2 words switches learners’ morphological computation strategies from decomposition to whole word processing. While previous cross-sectional studies have assessed the role of frequency on L2 morphological decomposition, this has not been confirmed by longitudinal data. The results support hybrid word recognition models claiming that frequency modulates morphological computation.","tags":[],"title":"Experimental increase in lexical frequency improves morphological computation of Spanish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Garrido-Pozú, J.J.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1714003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714003200,"objectID":"f1968bada6d6d8f3fe685772bcb0b078","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/publication/garrido-pozu_2024b/","publishdate":"2024-04-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garrido-pozu_2024b/","section":"publication","summary":"This study investigated the effect of cross-linguistic overlap in L1 and L2 auditory recognition of Spanish-English cognates. The study examined the correlation between objective and subjective measures of overlap and analyzed how these measures predict patterns in auditory recognition. 62 Spanish-speaking learners of English and 63 English-speaking learners of Spanish completed two auditory lexical decision tasks in Spanish and English and a rating task, where they rated the perceived phonological similarity of cognates. The results revealed moderate correlations between subjective and objective measures of overlap. While ortho-graphic overlap had no effect, increased phonological overlap facilitated recognition in L1 and L2 Spanish and English and had larger effects in L2 recognition. Perceived similarity was the best predictor among the measures of overlap.

They listened to lists of Spanish words as they saw a CV or CVC syllable (e.g., “pa” or “pal”) and pressed a button when the word began with the syllable shown on the screen. The task manipulated syllable structure (CV or CVC) and consonant sonority (fricative, nasal, or liquid) of target syllables and carrier words. Target syllables either matched or did not match the structure of the first syllable in target carrier words (e.g., “pa—pa.lo.ma”; “pa—pal.me.ra”). The results showed that consonant sonority modulated sensitivity to syllable structure in both groups of participants. Spanish–English learners responded faster to matching syllable structure in words that had a fricative or a nasal as the second consonant, and English–Spanish learners responded faster only with a fricative consonant. Higher L2 Spanish proficiency correlated with faster target-syllable identification, but sensitivity to matching/mismatching structure did not vary as a function of proficiency.

A total of 225 adult L2 Spanish learners (L1 English) from the Northeastern United States completed a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task in which they listened to four utterance types and categorized them as either questions or statements. We used Bayesian multilevel regression and drift diffusion modeling to analyze the 2AFC data as a function of proficiency level and empathy scores for each utterance type. We show that learner response accuracy and sensitivity to intonation are positively correlated with proficiency, and this association is affected by individual empathy levels in both response accuracy and sentence processing. Higher empathic individuals, in comparison with lower empathic individuals, appear to be more sensitive to intonation cues in the process of forming sound-meaning associations, though increased sensitivity does not necessarily imply increased processing speed. The results motivate the inclusion of measures of pragmatic skill, such as empathy, to better account for intonational meaning processing and sentence comprehension in second language acquisition.","tags":[],"title":"Using intonation to disambiguate meaning: The role of empathy and proficiency in L2 perceptual development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Garrido-Pozú, J.J.**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691798400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691798400,"objectID":"407805893b442d1721e88fd5d2d45b31","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/publication/word-spotting/","publishdate":"2023-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/word-spotting/","section":"publication","summary":"Current understanding of speech perception suggests that the routines that listeners use to segment the speech signal for word recognition are language specific. English speakers exploit stress patterns for lexical segmentation whereas Spanish speakers use syllable structure. This study investigated L2 lexical segmentation and specifically examined whether L2 learners with a syllable-based L1 (Spanish) exhibit stress-based segmentation in L2 English. 81 English-Spanish learners and 72 Spanish-English learners completed a word-spotting task that manipulated lexical stress and syllable structure. Participants aurally identified English monosyllabic words embedded in disyllabic pseudowords. Results showed that Spanish-English learners transferred L1 segmentation routines to L2 English. Spanish-English learners exhibited syllable-based segmentation of English regardless of differences in lexical stress, which was more prominent as L2 proficiency increased.

Specifically, this study examined the role of noun transparency, the number of gender cues, and L2 proficiency. The results of an eye-tracking task revealed that Spanish monolinguals predicted the gender of upcoming adjectives much sooner than L2 learners. L2 learners used grammatical gender predictively, but their predictions were delayed compared to monolinguals. Advanced L2 learners predicted upcoming adjectives faster than intermediate learners. Notably, transparent nouns and a higher number of gender cues increased target fixations in all groups. Target fixations of advanced learners increased especially with transparent nouns, and target fixations of intermediate learners were higher with more gender cues present. The results showed that L2 learners can integrate L2 morphosyntactic information during rapid speech processing, and that transparently marked nouns and more gender cues aid gender processing.","tags":[],"title":"Predictive processing of grammatical gender: Using gender cues to facilitate processing in Spanish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lozano-Argüelles, C.","Fernández Arroyo, L.","Rodríguez, N.","Durand López, E.M.","**Garrido Pozú, J.J.**","Markovits Rojas, J.","Varela, J.","Rocafiguera, N.","and Casillas, J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626739200,"objectID":"32e57f901d46c2a9cfcd4afd3d502e3e","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/publication/double-phonemic-boundary/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/double-phonemic-boundary/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous studies attest that early bilinguals can modify their perceptual identification according to the fine-grained phonetic detail of the language they believe they are hearing.

We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, “voiceless” responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency.
