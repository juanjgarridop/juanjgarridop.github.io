Specifically, this study examined the role of noun transparency, the number of gender cues, and L2 proficiency. The results of an eye-tracking task revealed that Spanish monolinguals predicted the gender of upcoming adjectives much sooner than L2 learners. L2 learners used grammatical gender predictively, but their predictions were delayed compared to monolinguals. Advanced L2 learners predicted upcoming adjectives faster than intermediate learners. Notably, transparent nouns and a higher number of gender cues increased target fixations in all groups. Target fixations of advanced learners increased especially with transparent nouns, and target fixations of intermediate learners were higher with more gender cues present. The results showed that L2 learners can integrate L2 morphosyntactic information during rapid speech processing, and that transparently marked nouns and more gender cues aid gender processing.","tags":[],"title":"Predictive processing of grammatical gender: Using gender cues to facilitate processing in Spanish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lozano-Argüelles, C.","Fernández Arroyo, L.","Rodríguez, N.","Durand López, E.M.","Garrido Pozú, J.","Markovits Rojas, J.","Varela, J.","Rocafiguera, N.","Casillas, J."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626739200,"objectID":"32e57f901d46c2a9cfcd4afd3d502e3e","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/publication/double-phonemic-boundary/","publishdate":"2021-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/double-phonemic-boundary/","section":"publication","summary":"Previous studies attest that early bilinguals can modify their perceptual identification according to the fine-grained phonetic detail of the language they believe they are hearing. Following Gonzales et al. (2019), we replicate the double phonemic boundary effect in late learners (LBs) using conceptual-based cueing. We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, “voiceless” responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in LBs and supports accounts positing selective activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.","tags":[],"title":"Conceptually-cued perceptual categorization in adult L2 learners","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juan Garrido"],"categories":null,"content":"  \n \n","date":1555027200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555027200,"objectID":"96344c08df50a1b693cc40432115cbe3","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/talk/example/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/example/","section":"talk","summary":"Predictive Processing of Grammatical Gender by Native and Non-native Speakers of Spanish","tags":[],"title":"Predictive Processing of Grammatical Gender by Native and Non-native Speakers of Spanish","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Juan Garrido","Gilda Socarras"],"categories":null,"content":"  \n \n","date":1540512000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540512000,"objectID":"b5eba9e514744cce21d0cdf0042552c5","permalink":"https://juanjgarridop.github.io/talk/cognates/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cognates/","section":"talk","summary":"Aural Comprehension of Cognates:The role of phonological factors","tags":[],"title":"Aural Comprehension of Cognates:The role of phonological factors","type":"talk"}]
