      <description>Juan José is from Lima, Peru. He is a fourth-year PhD candidate in Bilingualism and Second Language Acquisition at Rutgers University. He holds a bachelor’s degree in Education with a concentration in English Language Teaching (TESOL) from Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal (Lima, Peru). He obtained a master’s degree in Spanish from Auburn University and a graduate certificate in Cognitive Sciences from Rutgers University. His ample experience teaching both English and Spanish as a second language inspired his interest in how L2 learners and bilinguals process, perceive, and acquire language.</description>
